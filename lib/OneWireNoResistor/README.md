OneWireNoResistor
=================

A slight update of the popular Arduino 1-wire library for AVR-based arduinos that...

1) Eliminates the need for the extra pull-up resistor (the big show)

2) Adds a busFail() function to let you test for a shorted bus

3) Slight updates to comments and formating
